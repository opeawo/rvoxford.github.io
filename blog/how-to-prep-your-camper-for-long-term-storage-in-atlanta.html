      <h1>How to Prep Your Camper for Long-Term Storage in Atlanta</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Travel trailers and campers sit for longer than they&#39;re used. Even active campers might take their rig out 15-20 times per year, meaning it sits in storage for 300+ days annually. How you prepare for those storage periods determines whether your camper is ready to go when you want it, or whether you&#39;re dealing with dead batteries, musty interiors, and worse.</p>
<h2>The Baseline: What Every Storage Period Needs</h2>
<p>These steps apply whether you&#39;re storing for 2 weeks or 6 months.</p>
<h3>1. Empty and Clean the Interior</h3>
<p><strong>Remove all food.</strong> Even sealed items can attract pests. The chocolate bar in the drawer or crackers in the cabinet need to go.</p>
<p><strong>Empty the refrigerator.</strong> Clean thoroughly. Leave the door propped open slightly to prevent mold and odors.</p>
<p><strong>Take out trash.</strong> Any organic material becomes a problem over time.</p>
<p><strong>General cleaning.</strong> Sweep floors, wipe surfaces, deal with anything that could create odors or attract critters.</p>
<h3>2. Manage Holding Tanks</h3>
<p><strong>Black tank:</strong> Empty completely. Add a tank treatment and some water, let it sit for a few hours, then dump again. Leaving waste in the tank causes permanent odor issues and sensor damage.</p>
<p><strong>Gray tank:</strong> Empty completely.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh water tank:</strong> Drain if storing more than a week. Don&#39;t leave water sitting—it breeds bacteria.</p>
<h3>3. Battery Decisions</h3>
<p><strong>Option A: Disconnect the battery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents parasitic drain</li>
<li>Battery will slowly lose charge over months</li>
<li>You&#39;ll need to charge or jump when retrieving</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option B: Use a battery maintainer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keeps battery at proper charge</li>
<li>Requires electrical access at storage</li>
<li>Better for long-term battery health</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option C: Remove the battery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Best protection</li>
<li>Store indoors in moderate temperatures</li>
<li>Use a maintainer at home</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Propane Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn off propane at the tank</li>
<li>Some storage facilities require propane tanks to be turned off or removed</li>
<li>Check facility policies</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Secure Everything</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lock all doors and storage compartments</li>
<li>Close and latch all windows</li>
<li>Retract awning</li>
<li>Stow any exterior items (steps, hitches, accessories)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seasonal/Winter Storage (November-March)</h2>
<p>Georgia winters aren&#39;t severe, but they require specific preparation.</p>
<h3>Water System Winterization</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is freeze damage. A single hard freeze can crack pipes, destroy pumps, and damage water heaters.</p>
<p><strong>Drain-only method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Drain fresh water tank completely</li>
<li>Open all faucets (hot and cold)</li>
<li>Flush toilet to empty bowl</li>
<li>Open water heater drain plug</li>
<li>Run water pump briefly to clear lines</li>
<li>Leave faucets cracked open</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Residual water in low spots can still freeze.</p>
<p><strong>Full antifreeze method (recommended for extended storage):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Drain fresh water system</li>
<li>Bypass water heater (if equipped with bypass valves)</li>
<li>Add RV antifreeze to the system using pump intake or winterizing kit</li>
<li>Run each faucet until pink antifreeze appears</li>
<li>Flush toilet until antifreeze appears</li>
<li>Pour antifreeze into drains to protect P-traps</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $10-20 in RV antifreeze</p>
<h3>Exterior Winterization</h3>
<p><strong>Roof inspection:</strong> Check all seams, vents, and fixtures. Reseal any questionable areas. Winter rain and occasional snow/ice will find any weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Tires:</strong> Check pressure. Cover if in outdoor storage to protect from UV.</p>
<p><strong>Cover the camper:</strong> A quality cover protects from debris, UV, and weather. Use a cover designed for RVs with proper support to prevent water pooling.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Storage (6+ Months)</h2>
<p>Extended storage requires additional attention.</p>
<h3>Moisture Control</h3>
<p>Georgia humidity causes mold and mildew quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Use moisture absorbers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place DampRid or similar products throughout the interior</li>
<li>Focus on bathroom, kitchen, under cushions, and closets</li>
<li>Plan to replace every few months if possible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ventilation considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vent covers that allow airflow while keeping rain out</li>
<li>Don&#39;t completely seal the camper—trapped moisture causes problems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pest Prevention</h3>
<p>Rodents love campers. They nest in insulation, chew wires, and destroy upholstery.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seal any openings (even small ones—mice can squeeze through tiny gaps)</li>
<li>Place mothballs in socks or containers inside (don&#39;t let them contact surfaces)</li>
<li>Steel wool in any exhaust or pipe openings</li>
<li>Electronic repellents (effectiveness debated but harmless to try)</li>
<li>No food left inside—none at all</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tire Care</h3>
<p>Flat spots develop when campers sit for months, especially in heat.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over-inflate slightly (3-5 PSI above normal)</li>
<li>Use tire covers to block UV</li>
<li>Consider moving the camper periodically to change contact points</li>
<li>For very long storage, consider jack stands to take weight off tires</li>
</ul>
<h2>Before Retrieval</h2>
<h3>Visual Inspection</h3>
<p>Before using after storage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk around the exterior looking for damage, leaks, or pest evidence</li>
<li>Check the roof carefully</li>
<li>Inspect tires for damage or flat spots</li>
<li>Look under the camper for anything unusual</li>
</ul>
<h3>Systems Check</h3>
<p><strong>Water system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If winterized with antifreeze, flush the system thoroughly</li>
<li>Refill fresh tank</li>
<li>Run each faucet until water runs clear</li>
<li>Check for leaks at all connections</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Propane:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on at tank</li>
<li>Check connections with soap solution (bubbles indicate leaks)</li>
<li>Test appliances</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Electrical:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reconnect or reinstall battery</li>
<li>Test lights, outlets, and appliances</li>
<li>Check breakers and fuses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brakes and running gear:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check trailer brake operation</li>
<li>Grease bearings if not recently done</li>
<li>Verify all lights work</li>
</ul>
<h3>First Trip After Storage</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t plan an ambitious first trip after long storage. Do a short shakedown trip to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify everything works</li>
<li>Find any problems before you&#39;re far from home</li>
<li>Reacquaint yourself with the camper&#39;s systems</li>
</ul>
