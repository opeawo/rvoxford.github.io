      <h1>Camper Storage Mistakes to Avoid</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>After years of seeing campers come out of storage with preventable damage, certain mistakes appear repeatedly. These aren&#39;t obscure issues—they&#39;re common errors that cost camper owners hundreds to thousands of dollars. Learning from others&#39; mistakes is cheaper than making your own.</p>
<h2>Mistake #1: Storing With Food Inside</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Even sealed food attracts rodents. A single mouse can cause extensive damage—chewed wires, destroyed upholstery, contaminated surfaces, and nests in insulation.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Wiring repairs can run $500-2,000+. Upholstery replacement varies widely. The smell from rodent infestation can persist after cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove ALL food—sealed packages, canned goods, everything</li>
<li>Clean thoroughly to remove crumbs and residue</li>
<li>Check every cabinet and drawer</li>
<li>Use rodent deterrents (mothballs, electronic repellents)</li>
<li>Seal any openings you can find</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #2: Leaving Holding Tanks Full</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Waste in black and gray tanks causes permanent odor issues, damages sensors, and can freeze and crack tanks in winter.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Sensor replacement: $50-200. Tank cleaning/deodorizing: $100-300. Tank replacement: $500-1,500.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Empty tanks completely before storage—every time</li>
<li>Run a tank cleaning treatment before final dump</li>
<li>Add RV antifreeze to tanks for winter storage</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #3: Ignoring the Roof</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Small roof damage—a crack in sealant, a loose vent—lets water in during storage. Water soaks into wall cavities, causing delamination, rot, and mold that isn&#39;t visible until it&#39;s severe.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Minor roof repair: $100-500. Water damage repair from ignored leaks: $2,000-10,000+.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect the roof before every storage period</li>
<li>Check sealant around every penetration (vents, AC, antenna)</li>
<li>Reseal anything questionable</li>
<li>This takes 30 minutes and costs $20 in sealant</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #4: Leaving the Parking Brake Engaged</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> The parking brake can bond to the drum over time, especially in humid conditions. When you try to move, you have frozen brakes.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Stuck brakes can often be freed, but may require professional service ($100-300). In worse cases, brake component replacement.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Release the parking brake before storage</li>
<li>Use wheel chocks to keep the camper in place</li>
<li>Leave the camper in gear or Park</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #5: Battery Neglect</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Batteries discharge during storage (parasitic drain from appliances, natural discharge). Once deeply discharged, batteries sulfate and lose capacity permanently.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Battery replacement: $100-300 each. Many campers have multiple batteries.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect the battery, or</li>
<li>Use a battery maintainer</li>
<li>Check battery monthly if possible</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #6: Storing Without Winterization (Even in Georgia)</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> A single hard freeze cracks pipes, destroys water pumps, and damages water heaters. Georgia gets several nights per winter below freezing—sometimes into the teens.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Water pump: $50-150. Water heater: $200-600. Multiple cracked pipes: varies widely but easily $500+.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winterize every fall—full antifreeze method is safest</li>
<li>At minimum, drain all water systems completely</li>
<li>Don&#39;t assume Georgia is too warm for freeze damage</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #7: Improper Tire Care</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Tires sitting in one position for months develop flat spots. UV exposure degrades sidewalls faster than miles do. Low pressure causes additional stress.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Tire replacement: $150-400 each, times 4-6 tires.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check and maintain proper tire pressure</li>
<li>Cover tires to block UV (or use covered storage)</li>
<li>Move the camper periodically to change contact points</li>
<li>Consider jack stands for very long storage</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #8: Choosing Storage on Price Alone</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> The cheapest facility may have poor drainage (flooding), inadequate security (theft), or management issues. One incident can cost more than years of savings.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Highly variable—but a single theft, flood, or major hail event can easily exceed $5,000.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit facilities before committing</li>
<li>Check drainage after rain</li>
<li>Assess security realistically</li>
<li>Consider value, not just price</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #9: Neglecting Moisture Control</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Georgia humidity causes mold and mildew inside stored campers, sometimes within weeks. The musty smell can become permanent, and mold can damage surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Professional mold remediation: $500-2,000+. Affected fabrics and surfaces may need replacement.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use moisture absorbers throughout the camper (DampRid or similar)</li>
<li>Allow some ventilation if possible</li>
<li>Check and replace moisture absorbers periodically</li>
<li>Don&#39;t store with wet items inside</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #10: Storing Under Trees</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Branches fall. Sap drips. Birds perch. Leaves accumulate and trap moisture. The &quot;free shade&quot; comes with significant costs.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Falling branch damage: varies from cosmetic to catastrophic. Sap and bird droppings damage paint and surfaces if left untreated.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose storage spaces away from trees</li>
<li>Covered storage eliminates most tree-related issues</li>
<li>If unavoidable, check frequently and clean immediately</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #11: Assuming the Facility Maintains Your Camper</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Storage facilities provide space and security—not monitoring, maintenance, or problem notification. Issues develop during storage and compound until you discover them.</p>
<p><strong>The damage:</strong> Whatever problems occurred while nobody was watching.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand that preparation and maintenance are your responsibility</li>
<li>Check your camper at least monthly if possible</li>
<li>Accept that you&#39;re not addressing problems until you retrieve it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mistake #12: Rushing the Storage Process</h2>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong> Quick storage without proper preparation leads to multiple preventable issues. The 2 hours saved by skipping prep can cost thousands in repairs.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow adequate time for proper storage preparation</li>
<li>Use a checklist to ensure nothing is missed</li>
<li>Do it right once rather than dealing with consequences later</li>
</ul>
