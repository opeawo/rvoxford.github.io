<h2>Cost Comparison Example</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario: Small contractor needing vehicle storage + small warehouse</strong></p>
<p><strong>Option A: In-town Atlanta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 vehicle spaces: $200/month each = $400</li>
<li>500 sq ft unit: $400/month</li>
<li><strong>Total: $800/month, $9,600/year</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option B: I-20 East Corridor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 vehicle spaces: $120/month each = $240</li>
<li>500 sq ft unit: $250/month</li>
<li><strong>Total: $490/month, $5,880/year</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Annual savings: $3,720</strong></p>

<h2>Oxford RV Storage for Business Storage</h2>
<p>Oxford RV Storage accommodates work vehicles and some commercial storage needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work trucks and vans</li>
<li>Equipment trailers</li>
<li>Company vehicles</li>
