      <h1>How to Protect Stored Vehicles During Atlanta Storms</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Atlanta&#39;s severe weather season brings real risks to stored vehicles. Hail, high winds, flooding, and debris can cause thousands in damage to unprotected vehicles. While you can&#39;t control the weather, you can choose appropriate storage and take steps to minimize storm damage risk.</p>
<h2>Atlanta&#39;s Severe Weather Patterns</h2>
<h3>Storm Season</h3>
<p><strong>Peak period:</strong> March through May (spring severe weather season)</p>
<p><strong>Secondary period:</strong> September through November (fall transition storms)</p>
<p><strong>Year-round:</strong> Isolated thunderstorms can occur any month</p>
<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p><strong>Hail:</strong> 2-4 significant hail events per year in the Metro area. Hail can range from pea-sized (minor) to golf ball-sized or larger (severe).</p>
<p><strong>Straight-line winds:</strong> Thunderstorms often produce 50-70+ mph winds, capable of blowing debris and toppling trees.</p>
<p><strong>Tornadoes:</strong> Rare but possible. EF0-EF2 tornadoes occur in the Metro every few years.</p>
<p><strong>Flooding:</strong> Flash flooding during heavy rain events. Affects low-lying areas and areas with poor drainage.</p>
<h2>Storage Type and Storm Protection</h2>
<h3>Outdoor Uncovered</h3>
<p><strong>Protection level:</strong> None against storm damage</p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full hail exposure</li>
<li>Direct debris impact</li>
<li>Flooding if drainage is poor</li>
<li>No protection from any storm element</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive insurance</li>
<li>Car cover (provides minimal cushioning, not real protection)</li>
<li>Choose facility with excellent drainage</li>
<li>Avoid spaces under/near trees</li>
</ul>
<h3>Covered Storage</h3>
<p><strong>Protection level:</strong> Good against most storm threats</p>
<p><strong>What it protects against:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hail (complete protection)</li>
<li>Moderate debris (roof catches most falling objects)</li>
<li>Direct rain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What it doesn&#39;t protect against:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flooding</li>
<li>Extreme winds (debris can blow in from sides)</li>
<li>Tornado-level events</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best covered storage features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solid, well-maintained roof structure</li>
<li>Partial side enclosure (better debris protection)</li>
<li>Elevated or well-drained location</li>
</ul>
<h3>Indoor Storage</h3>
<p><strong>Protection level:</strong> Excellent against most storm threats</p>
<p><strong>What it protects against:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hail (complete)</li>
<li>Debris (complete)</li>
<li>Rain (complete)</li>
<li>Most wind events</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What it doesn&#39;t protect against:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flooding (if building is in flood zone)</li>
<li>Building collapse (extreme events)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate-Controlled</h3>
<p>Same protection as indoor, plus additional building envelope protection.</p>
<h2>Before Storm Season</h2>
<h3>Choose Storm-Resistant Storage</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re in outdoor storage and storm season is approaching, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving to covered or indoor storage for the season</li>
<li>Understanding the cost-benefit (one hail event can cost more than months of upgraded storage)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verify Insurance</h3>
<p><strong>Comprehensive coverage:</strong> Should cover storm damage including hail</p>
<p><strong>Deductible:</strong> Know what you&#39;ll pay out of pocket</p>
<p><strong>Coverage limits:</strong> Appropriate for your vehicle&#39;s value</p>
<p><strong>Claim process:</strong> Understand what documentation you&#39;ll need</p>
<h3>Assess Your Facility</h3>
<p><strong>Drainage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has the facility flooded before?</li>
<li>How does water flow during heavy rain?</li>
<li>Is your specific space in a low area?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are there large trees that could fall or drop branches?</li>
<li>Can you request a space away from trees?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure condition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For covered/indoor: Is the structure well-maintained?</li>
<li>Are there loose panels, damaged roofing, or other vulnerabilities?</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Severe Weather Approaches</h2>
<h3>With Advance Warning (24+ hours)</h3>
<p><strong>If you have flexibility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider moving vehicle to more protected storage</li>
<li>For outdoor storage, ensure car cover is secured</li>
<li>Check that nothing is loose on or around your vehicle</li>
<li>Verify battery maintainer is unplugged (surge protection)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Document:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take photos of vehicle condition</li>
<li>Note mileage and any existing damage</li>
<li>Have insurance info accessible</li>
</ul>
<h3>Short-Notice Storms</h3>
<p><strong>If you can&#39;t move the vehicle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure it&#39;s locked and secured</li>
<li>Accept that outdoor vehicles are at risk</li>
<li>Have insurance documentation ready</li>
</ul>
<h2>After a Storm</h2>
<h3>Initial Assessment</h3>
<p>Before entering the facility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for downed power lines</li>
<li>Watch for flooding or unstable structures</li>
<li>Take photos of any visible damage to facility</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vehicle Inspection</h3>
<p><strong>Exterior:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walk around checking all panels for dents</li>
<li>Inspect roof, hood, trunk lid</li>
<li>Check glass for cracks</li>
<li>Look for debris damage</li>
<li>Photograph everything</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Underneath:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for flood evidence (water lines, debris caught)</li>
<li>Check for visible damage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interior (if flooding suspected):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check carpets for moisture</li>
<li>Look for water lines on interior surfaces</li>
<li>Smell for mold/mildew</li>
</ul>
<h3>If Damage Occurred</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Document thoroughly</strong> — Photos, video, written notes</li>
<li><strong>Contact insurance</strong> — Report promptly</li>
<li><strong>Don&#39;t drive</strong> until assessing whether it&#39;s safe</li>
<li><strong>Get professional assessment</strong> if damage is significant</li>
<li><strong>Contact facility</strong> — They may have documentation/footage</li>
</ol>
<h2>Flood-Specific Considerations</h2>
<h3>Never Drive Through Flood Water</h3>
<p>If your storage facility is flooded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for water to recede</li>
<li>Don&#39;t try to retrieve your vehicle from standing water</li>
<li>Water damage can be hidden and severe</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flood Damage Reality</h3>
<p>Even a few inches of standing water can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destroy electronics and wiring</li>
<li>Ruin interior materials</li>
<li>Cause mold that never fully resolves</li>
<li>Total a vehicle insurance-wise</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choosing Flood-Resistant Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ask if the facility has flooded before</li>
<li>Visit after heavy rain to see drainage</li>
<li>Choose spaces in elevated areas if possible</li>
<li>Avoid facilities in known flood zones</li>
</ul>
