      <h1>Best Places for Camper and Motorhome Storage in Atlanta</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Motorhomes and campers come in wildly different sizes with different storage requirements. A 19-foot travel trailer can fit almost anywhere. A 42-foot Class A diesel pusher needs a facility specifically designed for oversized vehicles. Understanding what your rig needs helps you find appropriate storage without overpaying for space you don&#39;t use or cramming into a lot that can&#39;t handle your vehicle.</p>
<h2>RV Types and What They Need</h2>
<h3>Class A Motorhomes</h3>
<p>The largest motorhomes, typically 30-45 feet long, 8+ feet wide, and often 12+ feet tall.</p>
<p><strong>Storage requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Long spaces (45+ feet ideal)</li>
<li>Pull-through access strongly preferred</li>
<li>Height clearance (14+ feet for covered)</li>
<li>Wide drive aisles for maneuvering</li>
<li>Solid ground surface (heavy vehicles)</li>
<li>Electrical hookup access helpful for battery maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Dedicated RV storage facilities. Most general vehicle storage can&#39;t accommodate large Class A rigs.</p>
<h3>Class B Motorhomes (Camper Vans)</h3>
<p>Compact motorhomes built on van chassis, typically 17-24 feet long.</p>
<p><strong>Storage requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to large SUV/truck storage</li>
<li>Standard parking space often sufficient</li>
<li>Most facilities can handle these</li>
<li>Covered storage easily available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Any vehicle storage facility. No special requirements beyond basic security.</p>
<h3>Class C Motorhomes</h3>
<p>Mid-size motorhomes with distinctive cab-over design, typically 22-32 feet long.</p>
<p><strong>Storage requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate space requirements</li>
<li>35-foot space typically sufficient</li>
<li>Watch height for cab-over (often 10-11 feet)</li>
<li>Most RV storage facilities accommodate these</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Standard RV storage facilities.</p>
<h3>Travel Trailers</h3>
<p>Towable trailers from compact (14 feet) to large (40+ feet).</p>
<p><strong>Storage requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Space length matching trailer length + hitch</li>
<li>Room to back in (trailer maneuvering)</li>
<li>Height varies widely—check with facility for covered storage</li>
<li>Larger trailers need RV-specific facilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to find:</strong> RV storage facilities for larger trailers; some general storage for smaller units.</p>
<h3>Fifth Wheels</h3>
<p>Large trailers that hitch in the truck bed, typically 28-42 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Storage requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to large travel trailers</li>
<li>Height often greater (many are 13+ feet)</li>
<li>Need appropriate maneuvering space</li>
<li>Typically require RV-specific facilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to find:</strong> RV storage facilities with fifth wheel experience.</p>
<h3>Pop-Up and Folding Campers</h3>
<p>Compact when folded, expand when deployed. Usually 10-16 feet closed.</p>
<p><strong>Storage requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal space needed</li>
<li>Almost any vehicle storage works</li>
<li>Low height allows most covered options</li>
<li>Should be stored closed (deployed creates wear)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to find:</strong> Any vehicle storage, some general self-storage with outdoor spaces.</p>
<h2>Types of Storage Available</h2>
<h3>Outdoor Uncovered</h3>
<p>Your RV sits in an open parking space.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lowest cost, most available, no height restrictions <strong>Cons:</strong> Full weather exposure, UV damage, hail risk <strong>Best for:</strong> Frequent users, budget priority, rugged rigs</p>
<p><strong>Atlanta Metro pricing:</strong> $75-200/month depending on size</p>
<h3>Covered Storage</h3>
<p>Roof overhead with open or partially enclosed sides.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> UV protection, hail protection, reduced maintenance <strong>Cons:</strong> Height limits, more expensive, less available <strong>Best for:</strong> Long-term storage, newer rigs, seasonal users</p>
<p><strong>Atlanta Metro pricing:</strong> $100-350/month depending on size</p>
<h3>Enclosed Indoor</h3>
<p>Fully enclosed building storage.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Maximum protection, climate options available <strong>Cons:</strong> Most expensive, limited availability for large RVs <strong>Best for:</strong> High-value motorhomes, multi-year storage</p>
<p><strong>Atlanta Metro pricing:</strong> $250-600+/month</p>
<h2>Where to Look in the Atlanta Metro</h2>
<h3>Inside I-285</h3>
<p>Limited options for large RVs due to land constraints. Facilities that exist tend to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>More expensive</li>
<li>Tighter spaces</li>
<li>Often converted from other uses</li>
</ul>
<p>Best for: Class B/small Class C owners who prioritize proximity over cost.</p>
<h3>North Metro (Alpharetta, Marietta, Woodstock)</h3>
<p>Growing area with some RV storage options. Generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate pricing</li>
<li>Mix of facility types</li>
<li>Can be crowded (high demand from suburban RV owners)</li>
</ul>
<h3>East Metro (I-20 Corridor)</h3>
<p>The Conyers-Covington-Oxford corridor has multiple purpose-built RV storage facilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally lower pricing</li>
<li>More space available</li>
<li>Purpose-built for large vehicles</li>
<li>Convenient for eastbound trips (mountains, Lake Oconee)</li>
</ul>
<h3>South Metro (Newnan, Peachtree City)</h3>
<p>Some options, particularly along I-85 south. Good for south-side residents heading to Florida or the coast.</p>
<h2>Evaluating Facilities</h2>
<h3>Space and Maneuvering</h3>
<p>For large motorhomes, this is the most important factor. Visit with your rig if possible, or at least drive the lot to assess:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you physically fit in the space?</li>
<li>Is there room to maneuver without 47-point turns?</li>
<li>Are drive aisles wide enough for your vehicle?</li>
<li>Pull-through vs. back-in requirements?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Height Clearance</h3>
<p>If considering covered storage:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#39;s the actual clearance? (Not the advertised number, the real number including any obstructions)</li>
<li>Is your RV&#39;s height measured accurately? (Include AC units, antennas, any roof additions)</li>
<li>Is there clearance for slightly uneven ground?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ground Conditions</h3>
<p>Heavy motorhomes need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable surface (gravel okay if compacted; soft ground not okay)</li>
<li>Good drainage (heavy rigs sink in saturated ground)</li>
<li>Level parking (prevents strain on frame and leveling systems)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security Appropriate to Value</h3>
<p>A $400,000 Class A diesel pusher deserves excellent security. A 10-year-old pop-up camper doesn&#39;t require the same level.</p>
<p>Match security to what you&#39;re protecting.</p>
